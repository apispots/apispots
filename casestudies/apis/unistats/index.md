# Unistats API
{: .ui .dividing .header}

>  APIs form the connecting glue between modern applications. Nearly every application uses APIs to connect with corporate data sources, third party     
   data services or other applications. Creating an open description format for API services that is vendor
   neutral, portable and open is critical to accelerating the vision of a truly connected world.

The Open API Initiative (OAI) was created by a consortium of forward-looking industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how REST APIs are described. As an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation, the OAI is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral description format. SmartBear Software is donating the Swagger Specification directly to the OAI as the basis of this Open Specification.

The **API Spots** project treats the Open API specification as its core.  All tools evolve around the Open API specification since it
is the most widely adopted spec in the industry and its presence enables automation, readability and quality of service.

### Supported versions

The API Spots project currently supports **v2.0** of the Open API specification (f.k.a. [Swagger](https://swagger.io){:target="_blank"})
and soon the latest **3.0.0** version.  Find out more about the latest specification [here](https://swagger.io/specification){:target="_blank"}.
